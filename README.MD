I created this by following [Academind's tutorial "ReactJS Basics"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS ""):

This tutorial introduced me to:
* Webpack
* State and stateless components
* Outputting dynamic data
* Passing information through props
* Bidirectional communication between components
* Two way binding
* The component lifecycle
* Routing between multiple components

I had to learn routing independent of the tutorial as the tutorial was not made
for React v4. After finishing the tutorial, I turned one component into a list
of top stories from the New York Times API. For this I introduced myself to Sass.

Here is a screenshot of the news component I built:
