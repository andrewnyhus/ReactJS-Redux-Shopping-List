# ReactJS Redux Shopping List

In this project, I used ReactJS, Redux and Sass to create a shopping list interface.
This interface allows the user to create new items on the list, update the value
of items on the list, update whether items on the list were picked up, and
delete items from the list. This interface also allows the user to view the
edit history of the list, and revert back to previous versions of the list.

## For this project I worked with the following:
* Reducers
* Combining Multiple Reducers
* Middleware
* Redux Flow
* State and Redux
* State and Immutability
* "Smart" and "Dumb" Components
* React Bootstrap
